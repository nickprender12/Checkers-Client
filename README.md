## About
This is a checkers and chat app I build to further my understanding of React and web-development in general. It is a work in progress and was my first attempt at implementing websockets for client server communication.
## Tech
- Frontend: <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">`React`</a>
- Websocket management: <a href="https://github.com/socketio/socket.io">`Socket.io`</a>
- Backend: <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express">`Express`</a>
